**Name**: update-dashboard

**Description**: Refreshes Dashboard.md with real-time statistics and activity

**Version**: 1.0

**Trigger Phrases**:
- "update dashboard"
- "refresh dashboard"
- "show status"
- "system status"
- "refresh stats"

## Purpose
This skill refreshes the Dashboard.md file with real-time statistics about the AI Employee system, including task counts, priorities, recent activity, and system health metrics.

## Behavior
1. Counts tasks in different states:
   - Pending tasks: Count .md files in /Needs_Action
   - Planned tasks: Count .md files in /Plans
   - Completed today: Count .md files in /Done modified today
   - Total processed: Sum of all tasks ever handled

2. Identifies high-priority items:
   - Scan all files in /Needs_Action
   - Filter for priority: high
   - Collect first 5 for display

3. Gets recent activity:
   - Read /Logs/[today].txt
   - Extract last 10 entries
   - Format as bulleted list

4. Calculates statistics:
   - Average completion time (if data available)
   - Most common task types
   - Peak activity hours

5. Writes formatted Dashboard.md file

## Dashboard Format
```markdown
# 🏠 AI Employee Dashboard

**Last Updated:** [ISO 8601 timestamp]
**System Status:** 🟢 Active

## 📊 Quick Stats

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Pending Tasks | [X] |
| In Progress | [Y] |
| Completed Today | [Z] |
| Total Processed | [T] |

---

## 🔥 High Priority Tasks

[If any high priority tasks exist:]
1. **[Task Name]** - [Brief description]
2. **[Task Name]** - [Brief description]

[If none:]
*No high-priority tasks at the moment* ✅

---

## ✅ Recently Completed

[If tasks completed today:]
- ✓ [Task 1] - [completion time]
- ✓ [Task 2] - [completion time]

[If none:]
*No tasks completed today yet*

---

## 📋 Pending Tasks by Priority

### High Priority ([count])
[List of high priority tasks]

### Medium Priority ([count])
[List of medium priority tasks]

### Low Priority ([count])
[List of low priority tasks]

---

## 📝 Today's Activity Log

[Last 10 activity entries from logs]

---

## 🎯 System Health

- **Watchers:** Active ✅
- **Last Task Processed:** [timestamp]
- **Average Response Time:** [if available]

---

*Dashboard automatically generated by AI Employee*
```

## Special Features
- Use emojis for visual clarity (🔥 for high priority, ✅ for completed)
- Include relative time ("2 hours ago" instead of just timestamp)
- Show trends if possible ("↑ 20% more tasks than yesterday")
- Color-code status: 🟢 Active, 🟡 Busy, 🔴 Error

## Error Handling
- If folders don't exist, create them
- If no data available, show zeros instead of errors
- If log files missing, show "No activity logged yet"
- Always succeed even with partial data

## Rules
- Update timestamp to exact current time
- Keep formatting consistent
- Don't include sensitive information in dashboard
- Sort tasks by priority then by time
- Limit lists to reasonable lengths (max 10 items)

## Implementation Notes
The skill should use file system tools to read, write, and manipulate files in the Obsidian vault structure. It should calculate statistics based on file timestamps and content, and generate well-formatted markdown with appropriate emojis and styling.
